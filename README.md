# PDF to .docx Conversion Tools

This repository now includes a set of tools designed to facilitate the conversion of PDF documents into .docx format, allowing for a detailed analysis of concepts with the added benefit of creating visual representations through Excel graphs.

## pdf-to-docx Directory

Within the `pdf-to-docx` directory, you will find several key components that make up the conversion toolkit:

- `README.md`: Provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the conversion tools, compile the .docx documents, and interpret the Excel graphs.
- `convert_pdf_to_docx.py`: A Python script that lists all PDF files in the current directory, allows the user to select a file for conversion, and converts its content into .docx format while preserving the initial format and tables. This script utilizes libraries such as pdf2docx to process PDF content efficiently.
- `analysis.docx`: A .docx file that contains a detailed explanation of all concepts derived from the PDF. This document is structured with sections for each concept and includes comments for clarity and future reference.
- `graph.xlsx`: An Excel file that features a graph visually representing key data and concepts from the analysis. The graph is designed with clear labels on axes and data points for easy interpretation.

## Compiling .docx Documents

To compile the `analysis.docx` file into a .docx document, you can use any software that supports .docx formats. If using the command line, navigate to the `pdf-to-docx` directory and run the following command:

```
pdflatex analysis.tex
```

This will generate a .docx document that includes all the detailed explanations of the concepts derived from the original PDF.

## Interpreting the Excel Graph

The `graph.xlsx` file contains an Excel graph that visually represents the key data and concepts from the analysis. To view and interpret this graph, simply open the file with any software that supports Excel formats. Pay close attention to the labeled axes and data points to fully understand the data presented.

By utilizing these tools, users can efficiently convert PDF documents into detailed .docx analyses and visually represent data through Excel graphs, enhancing the understanding and presentation of complex concepts.
