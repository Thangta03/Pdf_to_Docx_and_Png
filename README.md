# PDF to .docx and .png Conversion Tools

This repository now includes a set of tools designed to facilitate the conversion of PDF documents into .docx format and the extraction of images from PDFs to save them as .png files. This allows for a detailed analysis of concepts with the added benefit of creating visual representations through Excel graphs and organizing images in corresponding folders.

## pdf-to-docx Directory

Within the `pdf-to-docx` directory, you will find several key components that make up the conversion toolkit:

- `README.md`: Provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the conversion tools, compile the .docx documents, interpret the Excel graphs, and extract images from PDFs to save them as .png files.
- `convert_pdf_to_docx.py`: A Python script that lists all PDF files in the current directory, allows the user to select a file for conversion, converts its content into .docx format while preserving the initial format and tables, and extracts images to save them as .png files in corresponding folders. This script utilizes libraries such as pdf2docx and PyMuPDF to process PDF content efficiently.
- `analysis.docx`: A .docx file that contains a detailed explanation of all concepts derived from the PDF. This document is structured with sections for each concept and includes comments for clarity and future reference.
- `graph.xlsx`: An Excel file that features a graph visually representing key data and concepts from the analysis. The graph is designed with clear labels on axes and data points for easy interpretation.

## Compiling .docx Documents

To compile the `analysis.docx` file into a .docx document, you can use any software that supports .docx formats. If using the command line, navigate to the `pdf-to-docx` directory and run the following command:

```
pdflatex analysis.tex
```

This will generate a .docx document that includes all the detailed explanations of the concepts derived from the original PDF.

## Interpreting the Excel Graph

The `graph.xlsx` file contains an Excel graph that visually represents the key data and concepts from the analysis. To view and interpret this graph, simply open the file with any software that supports Excel formats. Pay close attention to the labeled axes and data points to fully understand the data presented.

## Using the `convert_pdf_to_docx.py` Script

As part of the conversion process, the script now creates a folder named "transformed file" in the current directory. Inside this folder, a new folder with the name of the converted file (minus the .docx extension) is created. The converted .docx file and extracted .png images are then saved inside their corresponding named folder within "transformed file". This organization helps in managing the converted files and images more efficiently.

## Error Handling Strategies

This section outlines strategies for handling common errors related to package dependencies and directory creation failures, enhancing the reliability and user experience of the conversion tools:

- **Package Dependencies**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages, the script attempts to automatically install them. However, if automatic installation fails, please ensure you have the necessary permissions and try installing the packages manually. Detailed error messages are provided to assist in troubleshooting.

- **Directory Creation Failures**: Before creating new directories for the converted files and images, the script checks if the directories already exist to avoid unnecessary errors. If you encounter errors during directory creation, please check the permissions of your current directory and ensure there is enough space available.

By following these strategies, users can mitigate common issues encountered during the PDF to .docx and .png conversion process.

By utilizing these tools, users can efficiently convert PDF documents into detailed .docx analyses, extract images as .png files, and visually represent data through Excel graphs, enhancing the understanding and presentation of complex concepts.
