# PDF to LaTeX Conversion Process

This README explains the process of converting PDF content to LaTeX, detailing the use of the `convert_pdf_to_latex.py` script, the purpose of the `analysis.tex` file, and how to view and interpret the `graph.xlsx` Excel graph.

## Using the `convert_pdf_to_latex.py` Script

To convert a PDF file to LaTeX form, use the `convert_pdf_to_latex.py` script located in this directory. The script reads a PDF file and outputs its content in LaTeX form. For usage, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python convert_pdf_to_latex.py <path_to_pdf> <output_latex_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_pdf>` with the path to your PDF file and `<output_latex_file>` with the desired output LaTeX file name.

## The `analysis.tex` File

The `analysis.tex` file contains a detailed explanation of all concepts derived from the PDF. It is structured with sections for each concept and includes comments for clarity. To compile this file into a PDF, use a LaTeX editor or the following command line instruction:

```
pdflatex analysis.tex
```

## Viewing and Interpreting the `graph.xlsx` Excel Graph

The `graph.xlsx` file contains an Excel graph visually representing key data and concepts from the analysis. Open this file with any software that supports Excel formats to view the graph. Pay attention to the labeled axes and data points for easy interpretation of the data.
